## Project summary

The world is undergoing one of the largest waves of urban growth in history. With that growth has come an exponential increase in population and vehicles on the roads. Existing roads, however, either do not have the capacity for high numbers of cars or are poorly designed due to lacking design technology, leading to traffic congestion. This build-up of stopped vehicles is detrimental to the environment as vehicles continue to emit carbon dioxide while they wait in traffic for hours. Although a lot of advances have been made to make cars pollute less, little attention has been paid to efforts to make cars drive less. Through machine learning, our team strives to simulate traffic conditions and obtain insights to determine optimal road configurations: road network structure, road signage location, and highway exit orientation. With these insights, our team strives to help reduce traffic carbon emissions and build smarter, eco-friendly cities.


This is how our solution, Traffic AI, can make an impact.

### The issue we are hoping to solve

We aim to reduce the carbon dioxide vehicles emit into the environment by decreasing traffic congestion. Moreover, we aim to develop technology that contributes to smart cities through self-driving car traffic coordination, further reducing carbon dioxide emissions. With our program, civil engineers and urban planners will have a data-driven tool to minimize traffic congestion.

### How our technology solution can help

Our solution will leverage machine learning to simulate traffic flow and analyze various parameters, including vehicle flow, congestion patterns, and carbon emission levels, to provide valuable insights that help predict efficient road networks and road signage.

### Our idea

Traffic is dreaded by many on their work commutes, school drop-offs, and daily errands. On average, each person spends 54 hours in traffic; some cities, such as Chicago, averaging at 155 hours per person. However, besides being inconvenient, traffic is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. As people wait in traffic, their vehicles continue to emit greenhouse gasses, annually releasing 63,000 metric tons of CO2 in the US alone. Our team aims to determine the most efficient road configuration and signaling using artificial intelligence. By providing contractors, consultants, and governments with this technology, new road systems can be optimized and existing roads can be analyzed to determine congestion-relieving strategies, reducing traffic holistically.  

A variety of factors cause traffic, one of them being saturation, which means that roads can not handle the number of vehicles that drive through them. Exit locations, number of lanes, and stoplight designs all play a role in potential road saturation. Another cause of traffic is poor road signaling. Abruptly closed lanes, hidden highway exits, and unannounced construction zones are all reasons why unnecessary traffic may be formed. Our technology targets all these traffic factors in order to mitigate them through efficient road system designs and strategic road signaling. 

Unlike current traffic simulators, our technology leverages the powers of artifical intelligence to simulate thousands of scenarios for any highway intersection. As the program is trained through these scenarios, it uses vehicle flow, congestion patterns, and preexisting highway configurations as parameters to deliver accurate insights on the efficiency of that highway configuration. For new road designs, users can input a location list and an estimated number of cars into the program, allowing the program to determine the optimal road network between the given locations. The program would take existing buildings, roads, and parks into account in order to generate a realistic road system that complements current infrastructure. Moreover, given that the US alone has more than 4 million miles of currently existing roads, our team wanted to address traffic in these existing areas as well, further making our technology unique. With our technology, users can improve current systems through better road signaling of highway exits, closed lanes, construction zones, etc. The program uses Pygame to simulate current road systems, so all the users are able to indicate where the obstacle is and an estimated number of cars. Then, the system can iterate through different signaling locations to notify the user which is most efficient. 

As we continue to develop this technology, our team will integrate features that make car behavior more accurate, such as patterns in popular locations at certain times. Since these features are associated with the user inputs and not the core framework, these additions will be seamless for users. Furthermore, we hope our program can expand into the autonomous car field, where our program could be used to help coordinate self-driving cars to reduce traffic.
